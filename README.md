### - Change in the education system:
    
The educational pattern should be completely changed. Students who have a liking for higher studies should be admitted to colleges and universities. Emphasis should be given to vocational education. Qualified engineers should start their own small units.


### - Expansion of Employment exchanges:

More employment exchanges should be opened. Information regarding employment opportunities should be given to people.


### - Population control:

The growth of the population should be checked in order to solve the unemployment, problem. Family planning programmes should be implemented widely and effectively.
